What was done:

The problem did occur in std::copy. Now sure why.

Changed array initialization to a for loop. Works great - except:
    -The for loop didn't initialize the last element
    -That caused the code to want something at position -834r234234 or something
    -SEGFAULT!
    
I mamanged to get std::copy to work if I expressed everything in terms of memory pointers on sBoxDecimalKey
I think it doesn't like 2D arrays.

Also, I re-named the main functions in KeySchedule and sbox so I could test some code, and I disabled the
part where it checks for the number of parameters. I changed those back before pushing, however.
